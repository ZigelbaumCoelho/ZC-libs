ofxUtils is an openFrameworks add-on that includes the following tools:

- hEvents:
  uses ofEvents to send messages between different objects or to any object
  that register to that event.
  Events are called by symbols (c++ strings) stored in a map that represent   
  them.

- hStringUtils:
  Some string conversion tools used by hEvents

- hTable:
  An  hTable is a list of values stored in a vector<double> in ascending 
  order.
  Can be used as a conversion table.
